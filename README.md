# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

This week’s homework requires us to modify starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that they’ve selected. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.

The password can include special characters. If you’re unfamiliar with these, see this list of password special characters from the OWASP Foundation.

I was able to successfully complete the task in addition to the task i tried few other possibilities

If the user enters a string instead of length of password when prompted: Was able to resolve it using ifNan()
If the user doesn't chose any option for it's password: was able to resolve it using a do while loop and repeating the process of asking the values until user has done so.
If the user presses cancel when prompted"Length of password" the function will return early and asking the user to confirm if they are sure about not creating a password.
If the user press cancels once we ask"Are you sure you don't want a password" then the functionality is not working but hopefully can fix it.
